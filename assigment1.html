       HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the web.
       It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
       "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,either within
       a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. 
       By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people,
       you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</a>

            Our HTML Learning Area features multiple modules that teach HTML from the ground up
             â€” no previous knowledge required.
        </p>
        <u>Introduction to HTML</u> <br>
        This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax such as looking at applying HTML to text, 
        how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a web page.
    </p>
        <p>
           <u> Multimedia and embedding</u>
        This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images
        can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.
        </p>
        <p>
           <u> HTML tables</u><br>
        Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features 
        such as implementing captions and summaries.

            CORS enabled image
The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the < img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a 
< canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

CORS settings attributes
Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as < img> or < video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

Preloading content with rel="preload"
The preload value of the < link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests
 in your HTML < head >, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you 
 therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering 
 machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render
    , leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

                <h1> <a name="semantic"><u> Semantic HTML</u> </a></h1>
                The core characteristic of a semantic element is that it clearly communicated its meaning to both the developer and the browser.
                 These elements clearly define its content.
    
            </p>
         <h2><u>HTML Semantic Tag Structure</u> </h2><br>
The following HTML tags can be used to break your page into identified parts:
<ul>
<li>
< header>: t defines a header for a web page.</li>
    <li>
        < nav>: It defines a container for navigation links.</li><li>
            < section>: This defines a section in a web page.</li>
                <li>
                < article>: This element contains the main part, containing information about the web page.</li>
    <li>< aside>: The < aside>content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.</li>
    <li>< footer>: It defines a footer for a document or a section.</li>
</ul>
